## How to use L2 Assets collection

The first is to rely on On-Chain functionality.

The second is to use SubGraph queries to improve speed by reducing the number of loop lookups.

Here's how to use On-Chain
```bash
    yarn gen
    yarn hardaht run scripts/gen-force-migration-assets.ts
```

To query using graph queries, you can do the following 
```bash
    yarn gensub
    yarn hardhat run scripts/gen-force-migration-assets.sub.ts
```
The following files are where L2 assets are collected and "generated 
generate-assets1.json, generate-assets2.json, generate-assets3.json"

- generate-assets1.json : v3 Pool assets are not being collected. 

- generate-assets2.json : v3 Pool assets have been collected.

- generate-assets3.json : Used to configure the service using the collected assets.  The main uses are Front, Contract.
